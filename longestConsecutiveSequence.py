class Solution:
    # time complexity: O(N)
#     Although the time complexity appears to be quadratic due to the while
# loop nested within the for loop, closer inspection reveals it to be
# linear. Because the while loop is reached only when currentNum marks
# the beginning of a sequence (i.e. currentNum-1 is not present in
# nums), the while loop can only run for nnn iterations throughout the
# entire runtime of the algorithm. This means that despite looking like
# O(nâ‹…n)O(n \cdot n)O(nâ‹…n) complexity, the nested loops actually run in O(n+n)=O(n)O(n + n) = O(n)O(n+n)=O(n)
# time. All other computations occur in constant time, so the overall
# runtime is linear.
# Space Complexity: O(N)
#  Take a num set and check if the previous number not in list then keep incrementing the streak
